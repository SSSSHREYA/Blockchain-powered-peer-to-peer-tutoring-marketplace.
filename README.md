**Title:  
Blockchain-powered Peer-to-Peer Tutoring Marketplace**

**Description:**  
This project is a decentralized tutoring platform built on the Aptos blockchain. It allows tutors to offer their services and students to book tutoring sessions directly, using Aptos tokens for payment. By removing intermediaries, the platform ensures secure, transparent, and trustless transactions between peers.

**Vision of the Project:**  
The vision behind this project is to transform traditional education systems by creating a global, decentralized learning network. We aim to empower both students and tutors by providing a platform where learning can happen without boundaries, intermediaries, or unnecessary fees. The goal is to make education more accessible, transparent, and rewarding for everyone involved.

**Future Scope:**  
In the future, this project can be expanded to include features such as:
- A rating and review system to build trust between users  
- Session scheduling tools and reminders  
- A refund or dispute resolution mechanism  
- Support for multiple languages and subjects  
- Certificates issued as NFTs to validate completed sessions or courses  
- A custom platform token for incentives and rewards
